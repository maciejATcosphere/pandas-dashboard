Task to follow and their pomodoros:
 ✔ setup the repo (install https://github.com/ipython/ipython) + .codeintel + sublime project @done (14-01-03 09:11)
 ✔ create random data (with some constraints) @done (14-01-03 09:24)
 ✔ inject javascript that will be used in the notebook (d3.js) (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython-in-depth/blob/master/notebooks/05%20-%20Notebook%20and%20javascript%20extension.ipynb) @done (14-01-03 09:35)
 ✔ send df to js and draw something primitive @done (14-01-03 10:32)
 ✔ create class RichPandas(df) that will have __repr_html__ (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Custom%20Display%20Logic.ipynb) @done (14-01-03 10:32)
 ✔ customize d3.js examples @done (14-01-03 11:41)
 ✔ create code that will recognize type of chart to generate for a given column and plot it @done (14-01-03 14:33)
 ✔ make charts interactive @done (14-01-03 15:41)
 ☐ make all charts updatable
 ☐ add full screen javascript (http://bl.ocks.org/jczaplew/4444770)
 ☐ add filter to the js charts
 ☐ add js filters that will enable the  filtering of DataFrame and return filtered DataFrame
 ☐ make each charts closeable
 ☐ allow saving of the configuration

 ☐ create sampler for big data
 ☐ make sure that pie and bar chart are sorted

 ☐ create a code to run the dashboard independetly (reading from csv)
 ☐ add dynamical legend to allow even more filtering
 ☐ add drag&drop option for variables and scatter plot, pie chart (where value is not count)
 ☐ add parallel chart to draw numerical data
 ☐ provide code for paralellisation of pandas
 ☐ HTM could observe what kind of visualiazation people are using and help them choose the best
